## Project Idea


We created a e-commerce website that sells art prints. The idea behind it was to demonstrate ability to be creative as well as to use advanced web technologies.


## User-Stories

As a user, I want to view all prints so I can choose which one I want.

As a user, I want to sign in, so I can purchase prints.

As a user, I want to add prints to my cart so I can keep track of my potential purchases.

As a user, I want to use my credit card to purchase prints.

As a user, I want to be able to see my past orders so I can keep track of how much money I spent on particular dates.


## 3rd Party APIs

Stripe:

- Allows users to make purchases with their credit cards.
- To test our code, enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 test card number to purchase prints.
